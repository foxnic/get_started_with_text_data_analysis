# Getting Started with Text Data Analysis in Python

This is a beginner's tutorial on how to analyse text data in Python, using a small and simple data set of dummy tweets. 

It will show you how to write code that will:

- **import** a csv file of tweets
- **find** tweets that contain certain things such as hashtags and URLs
- create a **wordcloud**
- **clean** the text data using **regular expressions** ("RegEx")
- show you what **tokenisation** is and how to do it
- explain what **stopwords** are and how to remove them
- create a **chart** showing the most frequent words in the tweets, and their frequencies
